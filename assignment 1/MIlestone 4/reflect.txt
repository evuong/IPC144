1. Briefly explain why you think this assignment has asked you to code a struct, Contact, that holds three other structs as data members.

It helps to clean up the code by putting all 3 structures into one. It also creates more consistency since every time we need to access the variables, it will be stored in contact and then the following structure.

2. What was the most difficult part of this assignment?

The most difficult part was to apply pointers into it. I am not too familiar with pointers so that was the part that took the most time.

3. How long did it take you to complete Milestone 4?

About an hour. Most of the code was already written from the previous milestones so all I needed to figure out was how to change it to fit into a function.
