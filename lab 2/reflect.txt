1- What do think is the most important thing you learned in this workshop?

The most important thing I learned in this workshop was trial and error. Retyping code in different ways and getting over my own frustration helped me ultimately finish the lab.

2- Why must you add .005 to the value derived when calculating the GST owing?

To solve rounding errors due to standard C compliers truncates decimal numbers.

3- What is the result of a casting operation?

Casting converts one type of data to another. It allows programmers to narrow or promote a number temporarily without losing its value. 


4- Why do you think you were required to use the modulus operator in this workshop?

To help teach us how to use modulus in calculations instead of just using a combination other operations. It shows us how modulus is more efficient.
